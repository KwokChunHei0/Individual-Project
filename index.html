    <h2>My Hobbies</h2>
    <p>As I have mentioned, I enjoy writing storys and scripts.</p> 
    <p>Same as other teenagers, I love playing computer games, but not as often as secondary school anymore.</p>
    <p>During long holidays, I watch movies. There are some best, impressive movies I have ever watched.</p>
    <p>Besides watching movies, I am more likely to watch animation/TV series since their duration are not too long and you can watch them at home anytime.</p>
